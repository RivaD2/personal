# Maps

**Author: Riva Davidowski**


### What does Maps do?

- This is a basic web app
- The application randomly generates a user and a company (a user with randomly generated name and other details and company will also have randomly generated details)
- Each user and company has a location property tied to it (longitude and latitude)
- I use this location to show them as markers on a Google Map

### Tools Used: 
- Parcel bundler to run TS in browser
- Google Maps API

### How to use maps:

- Run `npm i` to install all dependencies
