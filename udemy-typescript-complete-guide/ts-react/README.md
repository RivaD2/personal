# ts-react: A mini app to use TypeScript with React and Redux

**What ts-react is about:**

- The fetch button displays text and makes an api request to fetch list of todos
- Once they are fetched, they are displayed on screen
- When todo is clicked on, it is deleted
- The goal is just to understand how to make TS, React and Redux work together


**Tools Used:**

- Redux
- React-redux
- Redux thunk
- Axios

**How to use:**

- Run `npm i` to install all dependencies
- Run `npm start` to start up the app
