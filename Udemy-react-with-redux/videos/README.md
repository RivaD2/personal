# Youtube Browser Application

**What it will include:**

- User can enter in a search term
- Enter key will trigger the search request to the Youtube Public Free API
- I will do a search for videos matching input
- I will display videos on the right-hand side of screen
- User can select a video and have it appear in the center of the screen
- Title and description of video will appear as well

**Tools Used:**

- Axios
- Youtube Public Free API from console.developers.google.com

**How it works**

- React App will make use of Axios library by making network request over to the Youtube API. The Youtube API will respond with list of videos related to the search term the user entered in.
- That list of videos will be an array of objects where every object represents a different video
- In order to make use of the API, I have to use the API key by visiting 
the console.developers.google.com. After set up process I receive the 
API key


**Components:**

- SearchBar: User can enter in search term
     - User's typing will update state and trigger form submit event by clicking enter key
     - The search term will be sent back up to Parent component that will do the API request
     - On right-hand side, VideoList will render entire list of videos
     - Each individual VideoItem will be contained by the VideoList
     - VideoDetail will show the video player that will play the Youtube Video that has been fetched along with title and description


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
