# Songs: A simple app for selecting a song

**TOOLS USED:**
- React
- React-redux
- Redux
- Semantic-UI

**Components**

- App
- SongList
- SongDetail
- Provider: Implemented by React Redux
- Connect: Implemented by React Redux

**Design of Redux App**

- Reducers: Produces list of songs and records currently selected song. These are the two pieces of state.
  - This will be creating a static list of songs
  - This is to get an idea of the basics of Redux
- Action Creator `SELECT_SONG`: To change the state inside the Redux App

**How it works**

- The store contains all the state of the application. I take the store and pass it as a prop into the Provider
- The Provider is going to be rendered at top of application hierarchy
- The Provider provides information to all other components and is passed reference to the store
- Instance of the Connect component/tag will communicate with the Provider through the Context system(parent to child communication even if other components exist between them)
- The Connect tag is configured to reach back up to Provider to request notification when SongList changes. It knows what pieces of state I want from the store and what different action creators we want wired up.
- The Provider provides SongList back down and Connect takes list and passes it as a prop down into SongDetail component

### Final Result:


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
