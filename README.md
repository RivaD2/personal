I started this repo early on in my code journey. This was the beginning stage of learning HTML, CSS and JS. I started to build out some projects. As small as they were they gave me the boost I needed to join a coding bootcamp.

As time has passed, this repo now holds the code from Udemy courses and additional code challenges.
