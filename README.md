# Personal Repo
## This repo holds personal projects, code practice from Udemy, and is really a playground for trying fun and interesting code experiments!

I started this repo early on in my code journey. This was the beginning stage of learning HTML, CSS and JS. I started to build out some projects, although as small as they are they gave me the boost I needed to start Code 101.  As time has passed, this repo now holds my coding practice from Udemy courses and will be the place where more personal projects are stored.
