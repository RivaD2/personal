/* Fibonacci Pattern:
Write a function fib(n) that takes in a number as an argument.
The function should return the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence.
The first number in the sequence is always one.
To generate the next number in the sequence, we sum the previous two nums

//Big O: time: O(n) and Space of O(n) using Recursion
// Implementing memoization by using a fast acting data structure
// Use an object where the keys will be argument to our fn and value will be return value
// Memoization can help us solve dynamic JS problems
// If I don't pass in a second arg in fn call, by default a memo with a new JS object will be created
// Memoization cuts down our recursive calls


const fib = (n, memo = {}) => {
    // Is arg in memo?
    if(n in memo) return memo(n);
    if(n <= 2) return 1;
    // Recursive calls here 
    memo(n) = fib(n - 1, memo) + fib( n - 2 , memo);
    return memo(n);
